# dual-depth-peeling
A demo implementation of Dual Depth Peeling. As described in this paper:
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/src/dual_depth_peeling/doc/DualDepthPeeling.pdf

Models are loaded from a plain dump of vertex and triangle data in the format given in `loading/model_file_format`.
There is also an export script for blender: `loading/export_model.py`
